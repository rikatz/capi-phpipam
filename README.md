# Cluster API IPAM Provider - phpIPAM

This is a demo implementation of the new Cluster API IPAM provider feature, using
phpIPAM as our IPAM.

This is not suitable for production, lacks a lot of testing, etc.

The idea here is to help people willing to implement their own IPAM provider to 
use this repository as a demo.

## But really, what is this?

There is some explanation at https://www.rkatz.xyz/post/2024-02-21-implementing-a-capi-ipam-provider/ but mostly, this is 
a dumb implementation of a CAPI IPAM Provider to show how it works and how someone can implement their own :)
